### Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.  It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these 

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

**As you work through this notebook, follow along in the classroom and answer the corresponding quiz questions associated with each question.** The labels for each classroom concept are provided for each question.  This will assure you are on the right track as you work through the project, and you can feel more confident in your final submission meeting the criteria.  As a final check, assure you meet all the criteria on the [RUBRIC](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/37e27304-ad47-4eb0-a1ab-8c12f60e43d0/rubric).

#### Part I - Probability

To get started, let's import our libraries.


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
#We are setting the seed to assure you get the same answers on quizzes as we set up
random.seed(42)
```

`1.` Now, read in the `ab_data.csv` data. Store it in `df`.  **Use your dataframe to answer the questions in Quiz 1 of the classroom.**

a. Read in the dataset and take a look at the top few rows here:


```python
df = pd.read_csv('ab_data.csv')
df.head()
```

b. Use the cell below to find the number of rows in the dataset.


```python
df.shape
```




    (294478, 5)



c. The number of unique users in the dataset.


```python
df.user_id.nunique()
```




    290584



d. The proportion of users converted.


```python
converted_df = df[df.converted==1]
converted_df.user_id.nunique()/df.user_id.nunique()
```




    0.12104245244060237



e. The number of times the `new_page` and `treatment` don't match.


```python
((df.group == 'treatment') != (df.landing_page == 'new_page')).sum()
```




    3893



f. Do any of the rows have missing values?


```python
df.info()
```

    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    RangeIndex: 294478 entries, 0 to 294477
    Data columns (total 5 columns):
    user_id         294478 non-null int64
    timestamp       294478 non-null object
    group           294478 non-null object
    landing_page    294478 non-null object
    converted       294478 non-null int64
    dtypes: int64(2), object(3)
    memory usage: 11.2+ MB


`2.` For the rows where **treatment** does not match with **new_page** or **control** does not match with **old_page**, we cannot be sure if this row truly received the new or old page.  Use **Quiz 2** in the classroom to figure out how we should handle these rows.  

a. Now use the answer to the quiz to create a new dataset that meets the specifications from the quiz.  Store your new dataframe in **df2**.


```python
df2 = df[((df.group == 'treatment') == (df.landing_page == 'new_page'))]
df2.shape
```




    (290585, 5)




```python
# Double Check all of the correct rows were removed - this should be 0
df2[((df2['group'] == 'treatment') == (df2['landing_page'] == 'new_page')) == False].shape[0]
```




    0



`3.` Use **df2** and the cells below to answer questions for **Quiz3** in the classroom.

a. How many unique **user_id**s are in **df2**?


```python
df2.user_id.nunique()
```




    290584



b. There is one **user_id** repeated in **df2**.  What is it?


```python
non_unique_id = df2.user_id.value_counts().head(1)
non_unique_id = non_unique_id.index[0]
non_unique_id
```




    773192



c. What is the row information for the repeat **user_id**? 


```python
df2[df2.user_id == non_unique_id]
```

`4.` Use **df2** in the cells below to answer the quiz questions related to **Quiz 4** in the classroom.

a. What is the probability of an individual converting regardless of the page they receive?


```python
df2.converted.mean()
```




    0.11959708724499628



b. Given that an individual was in the `control` group, what is the probability they converted?


```python
df2[df2.group=='control'].converted.mean()
```




    0.1203863045004612



c. Given that an individual was in the `treatment` group, what is the probability they converted?


```python
df2[df2.group=='treatment'].converted.mean()
```




    0.11880806551510564



d. What is the probability that an individual received the new page?


```python
(df2.landing_page=='new_page').mean()
```




    0.5000619442226688



e. Consider your results from parts (a) through (d) above, and explain below whether you think there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the new treatment page leads to more conversions.

No there's not a single evidence to conclude nothing with only those values.

<a id='ab_test'></a>
### Part II - A/B Test

Notice that because of the time stamp associated with each event, you could technically run a hypothesis test continuously as each observation was observed.  

However, then the hard question is do you stop as soon as one page is considered significantly better than another or does it need to happen consistently for a certain amount of time?  How long do you run to render a decision that neither page is better than another?  

These questions are the difficult parts associated with A/B tests in general.  


`1.` For now, consider you need to make the decision just based on all the data provided.  If you want to assume that the old page is better unless the new page proves to be definitely better at a Type I error rate of 5%, what should your null and alternative hypotheses be?  You can state your hypothesis in terms of words or in terms of **$p_{old}$** and **$p_{new}$**, which are the converted rates for the old and new pages.

$H_0:  p_{old}  \ge   p_{new} $

$H_1:  p_{old}  <  p_{new} $

`2.` Assume under the null hypothesis, $p_{new}$ and $p_{old}$ both have "true" success rates equal to the **converted** success rate regardless of page - that is $p_{new}$ and $p_{old}$ are equal. Furthermore, assume they are equal to the **converted** rate in **ab_data.csv** regardless of the page. <br><br>

Use a sample size for each page equal to the ones in **ab_data.csv**.  <br><br>

Perform the sampling distribution for the difference in **converted** between the two pages over 10,000 iterations of calculating an estimate from the null.  <br><br>

Use the cells below to provide the necessary parts of this simulation.  If this doesn't make complete sense right now, don't worry - you are going to work through the problems below to complete this problem.  You can use **Quiz 5** in the classroom to make sure you are on the right track.<br><br>

```python
control_df = df2[df2.group=='control']
treatment_df = df2[df2.group=='treatment']
```

a. What is the **conversion rate** for $p_{new}$ under the null? 


```python
p_new = df2.converted.mean()
p_new
```




    0.11959708724499628



b. What is the **conversion rate** for $p_{old}$ under the null? <br><br>


```python

n_new
```




    145310



d. What is $n_{old}$, the number of individuals in the control group?


```python
n_old = control_df.user_id.nunique()
n_old
```




    145274



e. Simulate $n_{new}$ transactions with a conversion rate of $p_{new}$ under the null.  Store these $n_{new}$ 1's and 0's in **new_page_converted**.


```python
new_page_converted = np.random.binomial(n=1,p=p_new, size=n_new)
new_page_converted.mean()
```




    0.12054917073842131



f. Simulate $n_{old}$ transactions with a conversion rate of $p_{old}$ under the null.  Store these $n_{old}$ 1's and 0's in **old_page_converted**.


```python
old_page_converted = np.random.binomial(n=1,p=p_old, size=n_old)
old_page_converted.mean()
```




    0.11794264630973196



g. Find $p_{new}$ - $p_{old}$ for your simulated values from part (e) and (f).


```python
obs_diffs = new_page_converted.mean()-old_page_converted.mean()
obs_diffs
```




    0.002606524428689347



h. Create 10,000 $p_{new}$ - $p_{old}$ values using the same simulation process you used in parts (a) through (g) above. Store all 10,000 values in a NumPy array called **p_diffs**.


```python
p_diffs = []
for _ in range(10000):
    new_page_converted = np.random.binomial(n=1,p=p_new, size=n_new)
    old_page_converted = np.random.binomial(n=1,p=p_old, size=n_old)
    p_diffs.append(new_page_converted.mean() - old_page_converted.mean())
```


```python
p_diffs = np.array(p_diffs)
```

i. Plot a histogram of the **p_diffs**.  Does this plot look like what you expected?  Use the matching problem in the classroom to assure you fully understand what was computed here.


```python
plt.hist(p_diffs);
```


![png](output_60_0.png)


j. What proportion of the **p_diffs** are greater than the actual difference observed in **ab_data.csv**?


```python
p_val = (p_diffs>obs_diffs).mean()
p_val
```




    0.0156



k. Please explain using the vocabulary you've learned in this course what you just computed in part **j.**  What is this value called in scientific studies?  What does this value mean in terms of whether or not there is a difference between the new and old pages?

**This value is the p-value. This value is the strength of the evidence to reject the Null hypothesis, the close this value is to $\alpha$ (the percentage of type I erros you are willing to commit) we have the evidence to not reject the Null Hypothesis, the close this value is to 0 we have the evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis. In simple word the higher the value is the higher the probability to commit Type I error.**

**So based on this term since our $\alpha$ is 5% and the p-value is way above from this then we fail to reject the Null Hypothesis.**

l. We could also use a built-in to achieve similar results.  Though using the built-in might be easier to code, the above portions are a walkthrough of the ideas that are critical to correctly thinking about statistical significance. Fill in the below to calculate the number of conversions for each page, as well as the number of individuals who received each page. Let `n_old` and `n_new` refer the the number of rows associated with the old page and new pages, respectively.


```python
import statsmodels.api as sm

convert_old = control_df.converted.sum()
convert_new = treatment_df.converted.sum()
n_old = control_df.user_id.nunique()
n_new = treatment_df.user_id.nunique()
```

m. Now use `stats.proportions_ztest` to compute your test statistic and p-value.  [Here](http://knowledgetack.com/python/statsmodels/proportions_ztest/) is a helpful link on using the built in.


```python
count = np.array([convert_new, convert_old])
nobs = np.array([n_new, n_old])
```


```python
z_score, p_value = sm.stats.proportions_ztest(count, nobs, alternative='larger')
```


```python
z_score
```




    -1.3109241984234394




```python
p_value
```




    0.9050583127590245




```python
from scipy.stats import norm

norm.cdf(z_score) # this calculate the significe of the z-score
```




    0.09494168724097551




```python
norm.ppf(0.975) # this will calculate the critical value of the z-score
```




    1.959963984540054



n. What do the z-score and p-value you computed in the previous question mean for the conversion rates of the old and new pages?  Do they agree with the findings in parts **j.** and **k.**?

**The z-score is the standard deveation from the mean of each value. That means tha if the z-score is negative he is on the left side of the bell curve, if is positive on the right side.**

**Since our critical value from 95% of confidence  for z-score is 1.95 and our z-score is -1.31 and with our p-value is far from 0 we fail to reject the null hypothesis. That mean the number of converted in old page is not greater then number of converted in new pages.**

**This not differ from `j` and `k` since the `j` p-value is way far from 5% and in the `m` the p-value is 90.5% wich means that we fail to reject the null hypothesis in both cases. But in `m` the probability of Type I Error is extremely high and in `j` the probability is volatile (but still far from 5%).**

<a id='regression'></a>
### Part III - A regression approach

`1.` In this final part, you will see that the result you achieved in the A/B test in Part II above can also be achieved by performing regression.<br><br> 

a. Since each row is either a conversion or no conversion, what type of regression should you be performing in this case?

**Since converted variable is a cattegorical type we shold use logistic regretion.**

b. The goal is to use **statsmodels** to fit the regression model you specified in part **a.** to see if there is a significant difference in conversion based on which page a customer receives. However, you first need to create in df2 a column for the intercept, and create a dummy variable column for which page each user received.  Add an **intercept** column, as well as an **ab_page** column, which is 1 when an individual receives the **treatment** and 0 if **control**.


```python
df2['intercept'] = 1
df2[['control','ab_page']] = pd.get_dummies(df2.group)
df2.drop('control',axis=1, inplace=True)
df2.head()
```

c. Use **statsmodels** to instantiate your regression model on the two columns you created in part b., then fit the model using the two columns you created in part **b.** to predict whether or not an individual converts. 


```python
logit_mod = sm.Logit(df2.converted, df2[['intercept','ab_page']])
```

d. Provide the summary of your model below, and use it as necessary to answer the following questions.


```python
results = logit_mod.fit()
results.summary()

e. What is the p-value associated with **ab_page**? Why does it differ from the value you found in **Part II**?<br><br>  **Hint**: What are the null and alternative hypotheses associated with your regression model, and how do they compare to the null and alternative hypotheses in **Part II**?

**The p-value for ab_page is 0.190.**

**It's null hypotheses is this:**

$H_0:$  ab_page $ = 0 $

$H_1:$ ab_page $ \ne 0 $

**In `Part II` the p-value is a Righ-tail test, but in the `Part III` is a Two-tail test.**

f. Now, you are considering other things that might influence whether or not an individual converts.  Discuss why it is a good idea to consider other factors to add into your regression model.  Are there any disadvantages to adding additional terms into your regression model?

**The advantage of consider other factors in, can give us a better understanding of the problem and the correlation of the variables, and see the correlation of more variables. But it can lead to erroneus analysis, like a p-value increase with addition of a non correlated term.**

g. Now along with testing if the conversion rate changes for different pages, also add an effect based on which country a user lives in. You will need to read in the **countries.csv** dataset and merge together your datasets on the appropriate rows.  [Here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.join.html) are the docs for joining tables. 

Does it appear that country had an impact on conversion?  Don't forget to create dummy variables for these country columns - **Hint: You will need two columns for the three dummy variables.** Provide the statistical output as well as a written response to answer this question.


```python
countries_df = pd.read_csv('countries.csv')
```


```python
df2 = df2.merge(countries_df, on='user_id')
```


```python
countries_dummy = pd.get_dummies(df2.country)
df2 = df2.join(countries_dummy)
```


```python
logit_mod2 = sm.Logit(df2.converted, df2[['intercept','ab_page','CA','UK']])
results2 = logit_mod2.fit()

**As we can see the p-value of ab_page increased one when combined with other countries, and both of then have the $p-value > \alpha$ wich means that they don't have a statistical significance, the UK have the worst of both.**

h. Though you have now looked at the individual factors of country and page on conversion, we would now like to look at an interaction between page and country to see if there significant effects on conversion.  Create the necessary additional columns, and fit the new model.  

Provide the summary results, and your conclusions based on the results.


```python
df2['UK_ab_page'] = df2.UK*df2.ab_page
df2['US_ab_page'] = df2.US*df2.ab_page
df2['CA_ab_page'] = df2.CA*df2.ab_page
```


```python
logit_mod3 = sm.Logit(df2.converted, df2[['intercept','UK_ab_page','CA_ab_page','US_ab_page']])
results3 = logit_mod3.fit()
```
